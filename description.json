   "description" : "This is a Mod with tools and parts for [b]vanilla logic.[/b]\r\n\r\nIt now comes with new parts like the [b]Quick Logic Gates[/b] that are not only [b]thousands of times faster[/b] than regular Logic Gates but also open a whole new world of possibilities.\r\n\r\n[h1]Tools[/h1]\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[list]\r\n[*][b]Connection Copy/Paste[/b]\r\nCopy from: light pink logic gate (or button/switch/etc.)\r\nPaste to: light orange logic gates (or buttons/switches/etc.)\r\nApply copy/paste: Press E on this block\r\n\r\n[*][b]Parallel Connections[/b]\r\nOn/Off: Press E on this block\r\nFrom: dark-grey (1st) & black (rest)\r\nTo: light-grey (1st) & white (rest)\r\nConnect dark-grey to light-grey to make a parallel connection.\r\n\r\n[*][b]Connection Maker (by Color)[/b]\r\nFrom: [custom color 1]\r\nTo: [custom color 2]\r\nApply: Press E on this block\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[h2]The Quick Logic System[/h2]\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[list]\r\n[*][b]Quick Logic Gates[/b]\r\nWorks just like a normal Logic Gate, but can be [b]much[/b] faster!\r\n(Up to 8192x faster, any more is too risky performance wise)\r\n\r\n[*][b]Quick Logic Controller[/b]\r\nThis is the brain of the operation that makes the Quick Logic System work.\r\nPress E or Crouch + E to change Quick Logic speed.\r\n(Only needed once in every world)\r\n\r\n[*][b]Interface Block[/b]\r\nWith this block you make interfaces for more Special Blocks. The size and color of the interface are important for the different inputs and outputs of the Special Block. For now it will be used with the RAM Block.\r\n\r\n[*][b]RAM Block[/b]\r\nThis is a Special Block so it needs Interface Blocks to work. It enables (almost) unlimited storage at full Quick Logic speed and takes only a few blocks to setup.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n\r\n[b]Converting old circuits to Quick Logic[/b]\r\nI uploaded a python script to [url=https://github.com/HerrVincling/QuickGateConverter]Github[/url], which will convert all logic gates in a [i]blueprint.json[/i] file to Quick logic gates.\r\n\r\n[b]Information about Quick Logic Gates:[/b]\r\nThese new Logic Gates will compute multiple steps ahead every in-game tick. Depending on the setting in the controller those steps can be as high as 8192 per tick. In contrast, a normal Logic Gate only does 1 step every tick (as we all know).\r\n\r\n[b]Upcoming features: (not guaranteed, just ideas that I'm making and testing)[/b]\r\n-Colored connections?? ;D\r\n-Logic Gate Mode Changer\r\n-Parallel Connection Copy/Paste (in Beta)\r\n-Parallel Logic Merger (in Beta)\r\n-Paint & Wire Memory (in Beta)\r\n-Color Connection Remover (in Beta)\r\n-Relative Color Connection Maker (in Beta)\r\n-More Special Blocks (Display, IC, Sensor & more)\r\n\r\nThe Beta is experimental, but has frequent updates and lots of exciting new stuff!\r\n[b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2608898394]BETA LINK[/url][/b]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you encount any bugs or issues, or if you have any suggestions, feel free to leave a comment!",
